# cellular-automata
Procedurally generated game, where nothing is forever.

Goals of this project:
1. Create a procedural world generation system that applies cellular automata with gradiated iteration for an infinite world
2. Make it explorable, with a means of interacting with it
3. Add multiplayer features
Idk, I think this is all we want to do in this, there may be more or less
